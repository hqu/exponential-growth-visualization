# Exponential Growth Visualization Chart Design and Evaluation

A Study of Stacked Comparing Line, Column, and Waffle Charts for Forecasting Exponential Growth

## Description
We conducted a design evaluation study to assess the efficacy of
using three different chart types (line, stacked column, and waffle)
to support forecasting exponential growth at variable rates. Hu-
mans tend to underestimate the speed and magnitude of exponential
growth, which are typically represented as an steep upward curv-
ing line graphs. We compared the conventional line chart against
a stacked column chart and a unit waffle chart with the hypothesis
that to the latter two visual encoding styles will nudge viewers to
increase their forecasts. Early results indicate that waffle charts
decrease underestimation, especially for periods far (greater than 4
periods) in the future.
